# School Analysis

In this challenge, we will provide some analysis of schools according to the spending budget per student, size of the schools(the numbers of students in each school), and type of the schools (public/independent).

School Analysis/Report

Obvious trends in school performance: Students demonstrate proficiency in both reading and math, with a negligible difference in scores. Approximately 73% of students pass both subjects.

Top-Performing Schools: Notably, among the top 5 schools, math performance stands out.Independent schools dominate the top performers, boasting an overall passing rate of around 80%. While having fewer students, these schools outperform government schools, with 3 out of the top 5 being independent.

Bottom-Performing Schools: Conversely, 4 out of the bottom 5 schools are government schools, with an overall passing rate of 66%. In these schools, students exhibit similar scores in both math and reading.

Grade-Based Analysis: Math and reading scores show minimal variation, indicating consistent performance across grade levels (9 to 12). The average scores remain relatively stable for each school.

School Spending Analysis: Surprisingly, a lower budget per student correlates with higher overall passing percentages. Schools with tighter budgets seem to achieve better results. Also, in the $585-630 budget range, we can observe the highest results compare to the other budget ranges.

School Size Impact: Schools with fewer than 2000 students excel, particularly in math. Larger schools (more than 2000 students) show similar performance in both subjects, but their overall performance is slightly lower than smaller schools.

School Type Comparison: Independent schools consistently outperform government schools, with a higher percentage of students passing math compared to reading.
